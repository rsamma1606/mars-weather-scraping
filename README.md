Project Description:
Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table using Beautifulsoup, Pymongo and Splinter 

## Instructions
To execute the project, the following steps should be followed:
  1) git clone https://github.com/rsamma1606/mars-weather-scraping.git
  2) Execute 'mars_data_challenge_part_1'
  3) Execute 'mars_data_challenge_part_2'

## Outputs
The following are the outputs:
  1) mars_data_challenge_part_1: 
  
    Scraped the website: https://redplanetscience.com/ using splinter and beautiful soup
                                 
    Stored the scraped results in Python Datastructures
                                 
    Displayed the items in MongoDB
  
  2)mars_data_challenge_part_2: 
  
    Manually scraped the data in the HTML using splinter and Beautiful soup
                                
    Assembled the scraped data into a pandas dataframe
                                
    Determined the number of months existing on mars
                                
    Determined the number of martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset
                                
    Determined the coldest and warmest months based on the average monthly minimum daily temperatures
                               
    Determined the months with lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on mars
                                
    Determined the number of Earth days in a Martian year based on the plot
